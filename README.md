# h4r_ev3_ctrl

NOTE: This node requires a **ROS installation on the EV3** because it is meant to **run on the EV3**.  
(it's used inside my EV3 Yocto Layer https://github.com/Hacks4ROS/meta-h4r-ev3 )  
  

NOTE2: It is recommended to directly start this node without rosrun or roslaunch (python (which is used by run and launch) uses a lot of resources)

This repository contains the node for the Lego EV3 for ROS.
(WORK IN PROGRESS! Heavy changes can and probably will happen!)
